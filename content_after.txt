Britain
and America are different societies, then, and, as Owolade points
out, “race doesn’t define British society the same way it defines
American society.” This isn’t the same thing as claiming that
Britain doesn’t have its own long history of racism or that race
doesn’t still structure British society. It does—but in a very
different way from the American model because of our very different
history.  Most black Britons came here in two waves of post-war
migration: first from the Caribbean and later from Africa. Most black
Americans are the product of the human trafficking that formed the
basis of the Atlantic slave trade and can trace their presence in
America all the way back to the seventeenth century—longer than
most white Americans. Moreover, there were no slave plantations in
Britain itself—the slave plantations that financed the British
Empire were located in the colonies—nor were there ever any
equivalents of Jim Crow or redlining. There were, however, many
unofficial attempts to enforce segregation in social venues, such as
“No blacks” signs at pubs, until the 1968 Race Relations Act
outlawed this.
